<h3>I. Introduction - What does APS/NWNX do ?</h3>

<p>The Avlis Persistence System (APS) is a set of scripts for NWN that
offer a set of functions you can use to send SQL queries to the NWN Extender
(NWNX) and conveniently process the results gathered from a database.

<p>NWNX2 is a program that loads the NWN server and injects the database
functionality into the server. Setting special string variables using NWScript
triggers the database requests. The resulting data can be read with the usual
string functions.

<p>The database has been tested with Microsoft Access and MySQL so far. Conceivably,
any database with a decent ODBC driver will work.

<p>After NWNX2 has loaded the server and rotated the log files, it takes over
responsibility for restarting the server should it crash. It does not depend on
a specific version of the server (1.29 as of this writing) and thus should work
with upcoming releases, too. The current version has been tested on the following
Linux distributions: Debian 3.0 (woody).

<p>We have included a demo module that illustrates how to use APS/NWNX and makes
creating the database tables easy, and a second module demonstrating how
persistent containers can be implemented.

<p><b>Licence</b><br>
APS and NWNX are distributed unter the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
included in <a href="licence.txt">licence.txt</a>.

<h3>II. Installing NWNX</h3>

Download the file, place it in a temporary directory and untar and unzip the 
file (tar xvfz <filename>). After compiling the package with the usual steps 
(./configure and make) copy the resulting binary <b>nwnx.so</b> and the file 
<b>nwnstartup.sh</b> into the directory where the nwserver binary resides. You 
will also need to create a file named <b>nwnx.ini</b> in this directory. The 
distribution contains an empty configuration file that you can fill out and copy 
there.

<p>Now edit nwnx2.ini and nwnstartup.sh and put in relevant changes for your 
local settings From your nwserver directory run nwnstartup.sh by itself or 
in a while loop like the following to have it autorestart on crash

<pre>
  while [ nwncheck != 1 ]
  do
    ./nwnstartup.sh
  done
</pre>

<h3>III. Installing and updating APS</h3>

<h4>A. Importing the erf</h4>
Import "aps2.erf" into your module. The .erf contains two scripts: aps_onload,
which shows how your module's OnModuleLoad event should look like and aps_include, which
contains all those nice functions that make APS fun to use;

<h4>B. Updating from previous versions</h4>
<ul>
<li>N/A
</ul>

<p>Have a look at aps_include. The function prototypes contain descriptions that should
help you to get started.

<h3>IV. Setting up a database for NWNX</h3>

Create an ODBC connection to your favourite database provider and name it "nwn"
(without the quotes). Create some tables you want to use for testing.


<a name="IV">
<h3>V. Running a module with APS/NWNX 4 Linux</h3>

Go to the directory where you installed nwserver and type "./nwnx2", without the quotes.
You will see some messages printed to the terminal by NWNX2 and shortly after that the
NWN server starts.

<p>Right before NWNX2 loads the server, it rotates it's own and the server's log
files. You will find directories names "logs.0.1"..."logs.0.9" below your "logs.0" directory.
The directory "logs.0.1" always contains the newest logs, and "logs.0.9" contains the oldest
logs. The directory "logs.0" will still hold the current set of logs.  All log files older
than those in "9" are deleted to preserve disk space.

<p>All SQL activity is logged to a file called "nwnx.txt". This file is created
in your "logs.0" (or .1, .2, etc.) directory and looks like that:

<pre>
   NWN Extender V.2.0.0.0
   (c) 2003 by Ingmar Stieger (Papillon)
   visit us at http://avlis.blackdagger.com

   * Connecting to database
   * NWNX2 activated.
   o Got request: SELECT item, count, identified FROM containers WHERE container='PersistentChest1'
   o Sent response (17 bytes): ARS_SKILLBOOK11
   o Sent response (17 bytes): NW_IT_BOOK01831
   o Sent response (18 bytes): NW_IT_TORCH00111
   o Empty set
   * NWNX2 shutting down.
</pre>

<p>The NWN Extender will make sure your server is restarted should the module
crash. You can specify any commandline options Bioware's dedicated server
understands, e.g. you can automatically load a module on startup with:
"./nwnx2 -module MODULENAME"

<h3>VI. NWScript Examples</h3>
This examples show you how to use the advanced features of APS. If you just want to
store and retrieve single values then have a look at the functions described in the
long documentation and in aps_include.
<ol>
<li>Store some data in the table "aps"
<pre>
   #include "aps_include"
   void main()
   {
   	string sSQL = "INSERT INTO aps (field1, field2) VALUES ('string1', integer1)";
   	SQLExecDirect(sSQL);
   }
</pre>
<li>Retrieve the value stored in example 1
<pre>
   #include "aps_include"<br>
   void main()
   {
       int rc;
       string sSQL = "SELECT field2 FROM aps WHERE field1='string1'";
       SQLExecDirect(sSQL);

       rc = SQLFetch();
       if (rc == SQL_SUCCESS)
       {
           int iValue = StringToInt(SQLGetData(1));
           // do something with integer iValue
       }
       {
           // not found in database
       }
   }
</pre>
<li>Work with multiple rows of data<br>
   Assume your table "tradeskills" has the following fields: player, character, skill, xp
   Now let's say you want to show the player what he skills he learned so far.
<pre>
   #include "aps_include"
   void main()
   {
       string sSQL = "SELECT skill, xp FROM tradeskills WHERE player='playername' AND character='charactername'";
       SQLExecDirect(sSQL);

       while (SQLFetch() == SQL_SUCCESS)
       {
           string sSkill = SQLGetData(1);
           int iXP = StringToInt(SQLGetData(2));

           // Tell player what he learned using the two variables above
           // ...
       }
   }
</pre>
</ol>
