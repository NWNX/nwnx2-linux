<h3>I. Introduction - What does APS/NWNX do?</h3>

<p>APS is a set of scripts written for Neverwinter Nights that work with NWNX2 to
produce reliable persistence in a module. At the heart of the APS is
an include file that lists a number of custom made functions for governing
persistence. These functions can be used as is in your module or changed to
suit your needs.

<p>NWNX2 is a program that loads the NWN server and injects the database
functionality into the server. Setting special string variables using NWScript
triggers the database requests. The resulting data can be read with the usual
string functions. It uses no hakpaks, and the only in-game NWN modification
necessary is the addition of either the script for APS, or your own custom
modified Structured Query Language (SQL) statements. Whenever a script wants to
generate a SQL query, it calls our APS functions and the Extender pulls the
query out of the memory of the NWN server. It then passes it to the database,
and writes the result of the query back into the memory of the server. The
database has been tested with Microsoft Access and MySQL so far. Conceivably,
any database with a decent ODBC driver will work. Also, because of the nature of
ODBC logistics, multiple servers can be linked up to one database file to
produce reliable cross-server persistence. A variable can be set on one server
and checked on another.

<p>After NWNX2 has loaded the server and rotated the log files, it takes over
responsibility for restarting the server should it crash. It does not depend on
a specific version of the server (1.29 as of this writing) and thus should work
with upcoming releases, too. The current version has been tested with the following
Linux distributions: Debian 3.0 (woody).

<p>We have included a demo module that illustrates how to use APS/NWNX and makes
creating the database tables easy, and a second module demonstrating how
persistent containers can be implemented.

<p><b>Licence</b><br>
APS and NWNX are distributed unter the terms of the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE included in
<a href="licence.txt">licence.txt</a>.

<h3>II. Installing NWNX 4 Linux and system requirements</h3>

<p>NWNX2 has been extensively tested on Debian Linux 3.0 (woody).

<p>Download the file, place it in a temporary directory and untar and unzip the 
file (tar xvfz <filename>). After compiling the package with the usual steps 
(./configure and make) copy the resulting binary <b>nwnx.so</b> and the file 
<b>nwnstartup.sh</b> into the directory where the nwserver binary resides. You 
will also need to create a file named <b>nwnx.ini</b> in this directory. The 
distribution contains an empty configuration file that you can fill out and copy 
there.

<p>Now edit nwnx2.ini and nwnstartup.sh and put in relevant changes for your 
local settings From your nwserver directory run nwnstartup.sh by itself or 
in a while loop like the following to have it autorestart on crash

<pre>
  while [ nwncheck != 1 ]
  do
    ./nwnstartup.sh
  done
</pre>

<h3>III. Installing and updating APS</h3>

<h4>A. Importing the erf</h4>

<ol>
<li>Place the file "aps2.erf" into the C:\Neverwinternights\NWN\erf directory.
<li>In the toolset, open up the module into which you wish to install the
scripts.
<li>Under the File Menu, click Import. A window will pop up.
<li>Make sure the contents of the C:\Neverwinternights\NWN\erf directory are
showing in the window
<li>Select "aps2.erf" from the list
<li>Click Import and ignore the message about the missing resource (click Yes).
</ol>

The following scripts should now be imported: aps_onload, aps_include.

<h4>B. Updating from previous versions</h4>
<ul>
<li>N/A
</ul>

<h4>C. Using the persistence functions</h4>

<ol>
<li>After installing according to the instructions above, go to Module
Properties under the Edit menu.
<li> Select aps_onload for your module OnModuleLoad event.<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;OR<br>
     Open aps_onload in the script editor and paste the contents of it into your
     pre-existing module's OnModuleLoad script. We only recommend doing this if you
     are familiar with NWScript.
</ol>

The functions below are now implemented. Here is a lexicon containing
information on their purpose and use:

<p><b>void SQLInit()</b>
<p>Setup placeholders for ODBC requests and responses. This functions reserves memory APS and NWNX
use for communication. Call this function <b>once</b> in the module load event.

<h3>IV. Setting up a database for NWNX</h3>

These are basic instructions on how to setup a database for APS/NWNX.

<h4>A. For Access</h4>

<ol>
<li><b>Create an ODBC connection</b><br>
NWNX tries to connect to a so called ODBC DSN with the name "nwn" on startup.
Here is how to create this connection: Go to Windows control panel, choose Administrative Tools,
choose Data Sources (ODBC). In the window that pops up, go to the second tab (System DSN)
and click "Add". Choose "Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)" from the list and hit
"Finish".

<p>A new window "ODBC Microsoft Access Setup" will appear where you have to make some settings.
The data source name has to be "nwn" (without the quotes). The description can contain any text you like. Next,
select "Create..." and browse to the location where you want your new database to be
stored. Type in a name (e.g. nwn.mdb) and hit OK. The new database has now been created and
all settings have been made. Click OK again to close the "ODBC Microsoft Access Setup" window.

<p>
<li><b>Database format</b><br>
You now have an empty database. In order to store data in it, you have to create some tables
in the database. The included module "aps_demo.mod" makes this easy.

<p>Start NWNX/APS according to the instructions in Section V.1 (see below) and load "aps_demo" in the
server. Next connect to your server with the Neverwinter Nights client. You will see several different
signs in front of you (from left-to-right): Create Tables, Store variable in database,
and Load variable from database. Each sign performs an action when you click on it:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Create tables: Issues a database command that creates tables in an MS Access database
<li>Store variable in database: Tries to save a test variable named "demoName" with the value
"testValue" in the database
<li>Load variable from database: Tries to retrieve the variable "demoName" from the database
and prints the results in the server message window.
</ul>

<p>Now click every sign once, starting with the one on the left (Create Tables).

<p>If the last sign sends you the message "Retrieved variable from database: testValue" your
setup is ok and you're ready to start using APS.

Note: This is the most basic setup. We encourage you to use more sophisticated databases
and data structures if you feel confident to do so (see below).

</ol>

<h4>B. For other databases</h4>

<p>As there is an almost unlimited amount of different databases out there, we can't give
detailed instructions for all of them. If you want to use a database server like MySQL
or MSSQL, try to follow the steps described above accordingly:

<lo>
<li>Create a database for NWN.
<li>Create a table "pwdata" with the following fields
player, tag, name, val, expire, last.

<p>Here is an example create statement for MySQL
(taken from aps_demo.mod, script demo_createtable):

<pre>
    SQLExecDirect("CREATE TABLE pwdata (" +
        "player varchar(64) default NULL," +
        "tag varchar(64) default NULL," +
        "name varchar(64) default NULL," +
        "val text," +
        "expire int(11) default NULL," +
        "last timestamp(14) NOT NULL," +
        "KEY idx (player,tag,name)" +
        ")" );
</pre>

<li>Create an ODBC connection to your database and name it "nwn".
</ol>

<a name="V">
<h3>V. Running a module with APS/NWNX</h3>

<p>After you have installed both the APS and NWNX, and you have written some test
scripts that use our functions, you are ready to begin running your server.

<h4>1. Initializing the module</h4>

<p>After you have built your module and saved it, you're ready to try it out. Go
to the directory where you installed the Linux nwserver run the command "./nwnx2".
You will see NWNX2 write some information to the terminal and shortly after that the
NWN server starts.

<p>Right before NWNX2 loads the server, it rotates it's own and the server's log files. You
will find directories names "logs.0.1"..."logs.0.9" below your "logs.0" directory. The
directory "logs.0.1" always contains the newest logs, and "logs.0.9" contains the oldest logs.
The current logs are always found in the "logs.0" directory.  All log files older than those
in "logs.0.9" are deleted to preserve disk space.

<p>All SQL activity is logged to a file called "nwnx.txt". This file is created
in your "logs.0" (or .1, .2, etc.) directory and looks like that:

<pre>
   NWN Extender V.2.0.0.0
   (c) 2003 by Ingmar Stieger (Papillon)
   visit us at http://avlis.blackdagger.com

   * Connecting to database
   * NWNX2 activated.
   o Got request: SELECT item, count, identified FROM containers WHERE container='PersistentChest1'
   o Sent response (17 bytes): ARS_SKILLBOOK11
   o Sent response (17 bytes): NW_IT_BOOK01831
   o Sent response (18 bytes): NW_IT_TORCH00111
   o Empty set
   * NWNX2 shutting down.
</pre>

<p>The NWN Extender will make sure your server is restarted should the module
crash. You can specify any commandline options Bioware's dedicated server
understands, e.g. you can automatically load a module on startup with:
"./nwnx2 -module MODULENAME"

<h4>2. Restarting and publishing the module</h4>

<p>Once you have NWNX2 and the APS running on your module it is very simple to add
updates to your world. Follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Open your module in the toolset and add whatever updates you like.
<li>Save your module appropriately.
<li> Shut down NWServer and NWNX.
<li> Restart NWNX as described above. Your module should start the same as
before with your updates live.
</ol>

<a name="VI">
<h3>VI. Customization</h3>

<h4>1. APS and persistence scripts</h4>

<p>The APS is merely a set of custom functions that were originally used for the Avlis
persistent world. The names of the functions and their parameters can be set to whatever
is convenient for your module. Below is a hypothetical example of how customization can be done.

<p>The "PowerG I33t" persistent world maintains their persistence with the Joe Bloe Persistence
system (JBPS). In that system, a persistent string is set with the following JBPS function:

<p>SetStickySring(string sVariableName, string sVariableValue, object oTarget)

<p>All 5000 scripts in PowerG's elite world are written with the SetStickyString function, and they
wish to retrofit their world to use NWNX. They would follow these steps:

<ol>
<li>Open up the file aps_include in the script editor.
<li>Change the name of the APS function called SetPersistentString to SetStickyString.
<li>Rearrange the parameters of:

<p>SetPersistentString(object oObject, string sVarName, string sVarValue, int iExpiration, string sTable = "pwdata")<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to:<br>
SetStickyString(string VarName, string VarValue, object oObject, int iExpiration = 0, string sTable = "pwdata")<br>

<li>Build the module, i.e. recompile all scripts.

</ol>

<p>Once the module is restarted, all of PowerG I33t's old persistent string scripts should be running the
new persistence system. All it took was changing one script.

<p>The above example is a simplified one, and the rest of the functions in the JBPS would need to be changed
in the same manner. In cases where the function parameters were completely not equivalent to those used
by the APS, they may have to be changed throughout every script in the module. Many but not all of the
persistence systems out there should be convertible by the above method. We encourage further modification
of aps_include to tailor the variable handling to your needs.

<p>For persistence systems that use tokens, conversion will not be as easy. In these systems, token items
are used to represent information on a player character. These tokens are not lost because they are
actually in the inventory of the character. Because these systems work with tokens and not actual variables
it will be hard to convert them into a database format. The module will most likely have to be completely
re-fitted.

<p>One possible idea to do this scriptomatically would be to write a module OnEnter script that strips the
character of their tokens and issues SetPersistent variable commands into the database before destroying
them. That would preserve the information that is there, but handling the actual scripts throughout the
module will have to be done separately.

<p>Alternatively, you can have a look at the GetPersistentString() function in
"aps_include". There are some comments in this functions that should give you
ideas on how to convert persistent data from your current system to APS.

<h3>VII. FAQ & Troubleshooting </h3>

<p><b>Q. What is NWNX?</b><br>
A. NWNX2 is a program that loads the NWN server and injects the database
functionality into the server. Setting special string variables using NWScript
triggers the database requests. The resulting data can be read with the usual
string functions. It uses no hakpaks, and the only in-game NWN modification
necessary is the addition of either the script for APS, or your own custom
modified Structured Query Language (SQL) statements. Whenever a script wants to
generate a SQL query, it calls our APS functions and the Extender pulls the
query out of the memory of the NWN server. It then passes it to the database,
and writes the result of the query back into the memory of the server. The
database has been tested with Microsoft Access and MySQL so far. Conceivably,
any database with a decent ODBC driver will work. Also, because of the nature of
ODBC logistics, multiple servers can be linked up to one database file to
produce reliable cross-server persistence. A variable can be set on one server
and checked on another.

<p><b>Q.What are the system Requirements for NWNX?</b><br>
A. NWNX has been tested with the following Linux distributions: Debian 3.0 (woody). If your system
processor can handle running Neverwinter Nights, it can more than handle NWNX.

<p><b>Q. Will there be a LINUX port?</b><br>
A. Umm...you're looking at it!!

<p><b>Q. Since NWNX is running the server as a child process, does the parent also have crash monitoring so it can
auto-reboot the server if it crashes?</b><br>
A. If the child process crashes, NWNX will reboot it. If the parent process crashes, nothing will reboot
it. However, it is possible to use some server monitor programs to restart NWNX, so long as they can be
set to monitor the NWNX process and not the server process.

<p><b>Q. Will I still be able to start my server up with firedaemon(or any other server crash utility)?</b><br>
A. NWNX will restart the server if needed. Firedaemon may possibly be able to restart NWNX instead of
the server, but we have not looked into this at all.

<p><b>Q. How does the data get read back into the module? When does this occur?</b><br>
A. As soon as NWNX detects that APS has issued a request, it sends that request to the database and
encodes the result set into a string. This string is copied into the space that has been reserved for
responses and can be parsed by the result set functions in APS.

<p><b>Q.You said you suspend the process during reading and writing to the memory of the child process. Any
benchmarks availible to how that works in a large persistant worlds?</b><br>
A. Achievable performance varies greatly with the used database, the ODBC driver, the network connection
to the database server, the CPU NWNX is running on, etc. That said, we ran a small test where APS
generated many queries per second and it handled 500 queries/second just fine on a 1GHZ
class PC (which was bored doing that, btw.) using a remote MySQL database server.

<p><b>Q. How will nwserver react when a read or write commit fails, such as when connection to the database
can not be established.</b><br>
A. It will continue running but persistent data won't be available. We ran a test where we shut down
our database server (MySQL) and restarted it 5 minutes later, all while APS/NWNX was running and issuing
queries. APS returned empty sets (i.e. not data) during the down time and came back up seemlessly. If
NWNX can't connect to the ODBC datasource on startup, it will notify the user of that fact and terminate
itself.

<p><b>Q. How are errors and null values handled?</b><br>
A. SQL commands resulting in an empty set, an error, or null value all result in an empty string sent to
APS.

<p><b>Q. Ok, enough techie questions, will I have to know MySQL and all of this database nonsense?</b><br>
A. Following the instructions in this document should be enough to set up a server yourself if you are
using MS Access or MySQL. However, any modifications beyond the scope of this document may require you
to know these programs. Ideally, NWNX is most powerful in the hands of experienced database users.

<p><b>Q. How much time does it take to upgrade an existing module to use the system? How about a newly created
module, how much 'planning' time would it take?</b><br>
A. That depends on how your module looks like. If you already have a fairly large module
with a lot of scripts that make use of persistence, we encourage you do write some lines
of code that convert the old function calls to the new ones (basically a wrapper around APS).
That's what we did for Avlis.

<p><b>Q. I do not own Oracle or SqlServer and will not use MySQL so what do you suggest as the DB backend?</b><br>
A. MS Access can be used, but we do not recommend it for large persistent worlds. The number of queries
in a short amount of time could conceivably corrupt the database after a while. If you are serious about
starting a large PW, some kind of decent database backend will be needed, like MySQL, which is free
software.

<p><b>Q. I am using the HC Rules with their PWDB. If I was to start the world up using this DB, would my
players info be lost when I switch to yours?</b><br>
A. Not necessarily. Data of most other persistence systems can be preserved and converted to APS,
but you'll have to change some lines of code. We don't have a conversion guide right now, so we can
only point you to the function GetPersistentString() in aps_include. There's a comment in there that
tells you how to read in old data.

<p>We converted our existing data by using the previous persistent data functions as soon as a database
query yielded an empty result, i.e. the value of a variable couldn't be found in the database. We
fetched the value using the previous functions and copied this data with APS into the database, so we
basically did a "conversion-on-the-fly".

<p><b>Q. I've successfully converted my existing data to APS. Do you want to include this info on how
 I did that in your documentation ?</b><br>
A. Absolutely. We really like to know what people are doing with APS/NWNX and if you think other
people may benefit from what you found out then don't hesitate to tell us.

<p><b>Q. Will you have pre-made stuff put in like banking, saving locations, health status, and housing?</b><br>
A. Much of the stuff mentioned in this question is easily scripted with NWScript. Most likely, people in
the community will get this stuff to work with APS/NWNX much more quickly than we could release it
ourselves. We encourage this, because it is what the community is about afterall. Still, the Avlis Team
may release things like this in the future on our own.

<p><b>Q. Does the system handle journal entries and explored maps? This has been one of many systems'
drawbacks in that journal entries must be coded into the system at design time. At this time it seems
no one has figured out how to get this to work.</b><br>
A. Journal entries are not inherently saved by this system, no. However, it could easily be scripted to
reinstate journal entries upon player login if the NPC conversations are designed this way initially.
Map exploration is not covered by this system because there is never a time when the state of the map is
converted to a string and sent to the database. Only pieces of information that can be converted to a
string with NWScript and sent to the database can be saved with APS/NWNX.

<p><b>Q. Could you give an example of how a chest/trap/locked door might be designed to take advantage of your
system?</b><br>
A. Persistent chests are a good example for this. Create a chest with a unique tag, and make some
scripts that take the objects inside the chest and store them as persistent objects on the chest itself.
This could be done OnOpen or OnClose depending on how you would want your chest designed. This example
would make use of result sets, which is the concept of one database query being answered with multiple
pieces of information. Opening the chest would send one "chest opened" query to the database, which
would return every object in the chest as an answer. Have a look at the included demo module
"pcontainers" where we used a different approach that works fine, too.

<p><b>Q. This sounds great. Where can i get the program?</b><br>
A. File section on Neverwinter Vault: http://nwvault.ign.com/

<p><b>Q. Any chance the source code will be open sourced?</b><br>
A. Eventually we may release the source code to the community, but we have no specific date on
this.

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

<p><b>Before doing any trouble shooting, make sure you look at the system requirements and are running a
compatible operating system.</b>

<p><b>Problem: I start up NWNX and the server doesn't come up.</b><br>
Solution: <br>
Make sure that you have created an ODBC datasource called "nwn".

<p><b>Problem: Persistence is not working for me. I installed everything correctly, and I built the module,
but there's no persistence.</b><br>
Solution:<br>
Make sure that every script in your module that uses the persistence functions has this line at the
very top of each script top:<br>
<pre>
    #include "aps_include"
</pre>
If you found scripts where you forgot to add this line, you must recompile that script after you add it.

<p><b>Problem: Persistence is working fine, but only NEW information is being saved. My old information from
my old persistence system is not there.</b><br>
Solution:<br>
There is no guarantee that your old information will be salvagable. Token systems are especially subject
to complete losses of old information upon conversion. Converting persistent token information to usable
database information is beyond the scope of this document. Persistence systems that use script writers
and log readers may be salvagable, but we cannot guarantee them either. The best thing to try, if you
are using a log reader system, is to make sure you have compiled your latest persistent data script from
your old system into your module. You may have to do some fancy custom scripting to develop a program that
reads your old values into the new system.

<p> See the question "I am using the HC Rules with their PWDB..." for a hint on how you can convert your
data.
